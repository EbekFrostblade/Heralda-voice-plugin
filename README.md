# Heralda, the helpful Discord Herald Bot

Heralda is a chat bot that announces the arrival of new users to voice channels in Discord. She uses voicerss.org to retrieve text-to-speech voice clips, which she then plays in the voice channel.

## This Component

This is Heralda's main voice plugin. It can serve as an example to create your plugins to tie into her API.
