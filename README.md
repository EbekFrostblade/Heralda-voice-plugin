# Heralda, the helpful Discord Herald Bot

[Heralda](https://github.com/EbekFrostblade/Heralda-chat-bot) is a chat bot that announces the arrival of new users to voice channels in Discord. She uses voicerss.org to retrieve text-to-speech voice clips, which she then plays in the voice channel.

## This Component

This is Heralda's main voice plugin. It can serve as an example to create your plugins to tie into her API.

### Commands

#### '@heralda get in here'

This summons Heralda to your current connected voice channel. You must send her a message in a public room in the same server you and her are connected to, and you must @mention her.

#### '@heralda get out of here'

This asks Heralda to leave the voice channel she is in. As with summoning her, you must send this message in a public channel for the server she is connected to, and you must @mention her.
